Property: "maintainer" SHOULD exist in the crate with expected @type ["Organization", "Person"] 
Description: A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project.

It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on upstream sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

Supersedes fileFormat.
